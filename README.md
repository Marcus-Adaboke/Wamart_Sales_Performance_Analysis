Walmart Sales Performance Analysis

Transforming Retail Data into Meaningful Business Insight

In this project, I analyze Walmart’s weekly sales performance across multiple stores to understand how sales evolve over time and what factors truly drive retail outcomes. Rather than focusing only on headline sales figures or holiday spikes, I set out to uncover underlying patterns, seasonal behavior, and the influence of broader economic and environmental conditions on everyday consumer spending.

I began by preparing and structuring the dataset to support meaningful analysis. Using Microsoft Excel, I cleaned and standardized the data, handled inconsistencies, and created time-based features such as year and month to enable trend and seasonal analysis. Pivot tables, slicers, and calculated fields formed the core of my exploratory work, allowing me to compare sales across stores, time periods, and conditions dynamically.

As the analysis progressed, I explored store-level performance to identify high- and low-performing stores and examined how sales vary throughout the year. Clear seasonal patterns emerged, revealing predictable peaks and slowdowns. When comparing holiday and non-holiday periods, I discovered a key insight: non-holiday weeks consistently accounted for higher overall sales across stores. This finding highlights the importance of stable, recurring demand and shows that everyday shopping behavior often outweighs short-term holiday surges.

To deepen the analysis, I incorporated economic and environmental variables such as CPI, fuel prices, unemployment, and temperature. I found that changes in CPI and unemployment are associated with fluctuations in weekly sales, reflecting sensitivity to broader economic conditions. Fuel prices and temperature also showed moderate but noticeable effects, reinforcing the idea that retail performance is shaped by external factors beyond internal operations alone.

To bring these insights together, I built interactive Excel dashboards that allow users to explore sales performance by store, time period, holiday status, and economic indicators. My focus was not only on visualization, but on interpretation and ensuring that trends, comparisons, and relationships could be clearly understood and translated into actionable insights.

Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to transform raw retail and economic data into a coherent analytical story. By combining technical Excel skills with analytical reasoning and business context, I show how data can be used to explain not just what is happening in sales performance, but why it happens, supporting smarter operational, promotional, and strategic decision-making at walmart.
