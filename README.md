Walmart Sales Performance Analysis


Project Overview

This project analyzes Walmart’s weekly sales performance across multiple stores, with the goal of uncovering trends, seasonal patterns, and the influence of holidays and key economic factors. The analysis explores not only peak periods but also typical weekly sales, providing a realistic view of store performance under normal and holiday conditions. By combining sales data with economic and environmental indicators, this project demonstrates how raw retail data can be transformed into actionable insights to support informed business and operational decisions.

Objectives

Examine weekly sales trends across Walmart stores to know top performing stores and Periods that generates the most Sales

Identify seasonal patterns and differences between holiday and non-holiday periods

Assess the influence of key economic indicators such as CPI, fuel prices, unemployment, and temperature

Provide insights to guide operational, promotional, and strategic decisions

Dataset

The dataset contains weekly sales records for multiple Walmart stores, enriched with time, economic, and environmental variables to enable comprehensive analysis.

Key variables:

Store – Unique identifier for each Walmart store

Date, Year, Month – Time variables for trend and seasonal analysis

Weekly Sales – Total sales per store per week

Holiday Flag – Indicator for major holiday weeks

Temperature – Average weekly temperature

Fuel Price – Weekly fuel prices

CPI – Consumer Price Index

Unemployment – Unemployment rate

Tools & Techniques

Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, pivot tables, exploratory analysis, and interactive dashboards


Data Cleaning & Preparation

Checked for missing or inconsistent values and corrected them

Standardized date formats and numeric fields

Created derived features such as Year and Month for time-based analysis

Structured the dataset to support store-level, seasonal, and economic factor analysis

Analytical Approach

Exploratory Analysis – Studied overall sales distributions, trends over time, and variations across stores

Store-Level Analysis – Compared weekly sales across stores to identify high- and low-performing locations

Seasonality & Trends – Analyzed patterns across months and years, revealing peak and off-peak periods

Holiday vs. Non-Holiday Analysis – Surprisingly, non-holiday weeks accounted for higher overall sales, reflecting consistent base demand and the scale of regular weekly shopping

Economic Factors – Evaluated the relationships between sales and CPI, fuel prices, unemployment, and temperature to understand the broader economic context

Dashboard Development – Built interactive dashboards to explore sales patterns by store, time period, and external factors dynamically

Key Insights

Base Sales Dominance: Non-holiday weeks often generated higher total sales across stores, highlighting the importance of consistent everyday shopping rather than focusing only on holiday peaks

Seasonal Patterns: Sales exhibit clear seasonal trends, with predictable peaks and troughs across the year

Store-Level Variability: Performance differs significantly between stores, reflecting differences in location, store size, and local demand

Holiday Impact: While holidays produce higher sales for some stores, the effect is not uniform, and many stores maintain strong performance during regular weeks

Economic Influence: CPI and unemployment are associated with fluctuations in weekly sales, indicating sensitivity to broader economic conditions

Environmental Factors: Fuel prices and temperature show moderate but noticeable effects on sales behavior

Dashboard & Visualization

Interactive dashboards allow users to:

Explore sales performance across stores and time periods

Compare holiday and non-holiday weeks

Analyze the effect of economic and environmental factors on sales

The dashboards focus on clarity, actionable insight, and dynamic exploration, enabling stakeholders to answer business questions effectively.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to transform complex retail and economic data into meaningful insights. By combining store-level trends, seasonality, holiday effects, and economic factors, it provides a holistic view of Walmart’s sales performance. Importantly, the analysis shows that consistent non-holiday sales often outweigh holiday spikes, underscoring the value of understanding baseline demand patterns. The findings can support strategic decisions in inventory management, promotional planning, and operational optimization, highlighting the role of data-driven insight in driving business and economic outcomes.
